## 🚀 SUMMARY
Having a passion for computers has led me to expand my knowledge in computer science from a young 
age.
I was absolutely attracted to computer sokware and games which later developed into an interest in 
programming.

I am mostly self-taught, as well as having a fundamental license degree in computer science from 
the Higher Institute of Computer Science of Mahdia.
I also have some experience developing mobile and web
applications as a freelancer.
